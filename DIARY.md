# Ajanthapan's Diary

## Week 1

### 25th September

Reasearched on ideas for what to base my website on. Also researched what databases and frontend tools I would be using for my project.

### 27th September

Went to my first supervisor meeting where we discussed further on potential ideas for my website (clothing brand or type racer game).

Also looked into ideas on how I can further get extra marks for my fyp; using a no SQL database would give me more marks.

We also discussed the benefits for using a no SQL database as it is more logical and easier to use than a SQL database.

Making start button go to game page and setting up basics in the page.

I want to in the future implement an API to generate quotes and have a functioning game.

### 22nd November

Implementing an API which contains quotes in my game and I disabled the react strict mode as it called the API twice. I also made the input box responsive within the container and i started making the quotes into seperate characters and started allocating colour to show if it is correct or not.

I want to in the future have a fully functioning game.

### 23rd November

Making basic functionality of the game work with color.

I want to in the future have have the words per minutes and timer working for the game.

### 24th November

I have made the timer work so that it only starts working when user is typing and made the quote generate a new quote after the old quote has been typed and the timer to reset as well when the new quote is generated.

I have later also finished the functionality for the words per minute and made a reset button so that when it is clicked it will reset the quote and the time.

I want to in the future start some AB testing to see what people perfer to be the background.

### 25th November

I have decided on using a new background image after conducting AB testing and also same for the Navbar which was for the better as it improved the look of the UI across all pages. I have also finished sign up page, making some touches to login page and also fixed small bugs.

I want to have a fully functional show password icon in the future as well as getting reset password page finished and starting shop page.

### 26th November

I have added a show password icon which also turns to a different icon when pressed and password can be seen to relevant pages. I have made the reset password page and also merged the branch feature-reset-password into main. I have also made a new navbar just for the shop page and have also made a shop item component which holds the functionality to add items to the shop.

I want to in the future also have finished the shop navbar and have some functionality for the shopping bag.

### 27th November

Fixed minor bugs with reset button on game page as timer was continuing after clicking on reset button. Added popup functionality for shopping bag and functionality in the shop navbar like having the highlight feature stay when clicked for the nav links. Adding filter to the shopnav as well so it filters through coins, themes and skins.

I want to in the future have done a component to see what held in the shopping bag and adding placeholder items in the shopping bag.

### 28th November

I made shopping bag look better by adding further CSS to it and also made a component called bag item which would be inside shopping bag.I also noticed error after doing user testing which I fixed, i disabled the input box after quote has been correctly completed.

I want to in the future finish my checkout page and add extra feature which would be used in the future like adding errot message for login page if wrong password has been entered.

### 29th November

I added functionality to the shop bag items so that whatever is added it would output the total price and I ahve completed the checkout page as well as adding a new feature to the game page which is to have a running animation to go around the text whilst user is typing.

I had my supervisor meeting and showed my supervisor my current progress with my game and he mentioned how it was good and he also told me that for the report I should have testing like user testing and AB testing, Ishould have documented my code with JS DOC and also advice on what to mention in my report like what frameworks I used and explain how to use my website.

I want to in the future have a car instead of a yellow circle as the object being animated and also making sure it rotates properly as well and make it go with how the user is typing.

### 1st December

I have made the car animation rotate properly as well as making it animate whilst the user is typing and I made it so that the car would go back to the start once user is done typing. I have also set up express.js for backend.
