### 27th September

Went to my first supervisor meeting where we discussed further on potential ideas for my website (clothing brand or type racer game).

In this meeting we discussed how I should not be divergering too much from my current timeline and how I am able to add feature which are currently not on my timeline like having an online feature. Supervisor also said that I should look into web testing so that I can do backend testing and went through features like making my website responsive would also give me additional marks.

### 27th October

I want to in the future implement an API to generate quotes and have a functioning game.

### 22nd November

Implementing an API which contains quotes in my game and I disabled the react strict mode as it called the API twice. I also made the input box responsive within the container and i started making the quotes into seperate characters and started allocating colour to show if it is correct or not.

I want to in the future have a fully functioning game.

### 23rd November

Making basic functionality of the game work with color.

I want to in the future have have the words per minutes and timer working for the game.

### 24th November

I have made the timer work so that it only starts working when user is typing and made the quote generate a new quote after the old quote has been typed and the timer to reset as well when the new quote is generated.

I have later also finished the functionality for the words per minute and made a reset button so that when it is clicked it will reset the quote and the time.

I want to in the future start some AB testing to see what people perfer to be the background.

### 25th November

I have decided on using a new background image after conducting AB testing and also same for the Navbar which was for the better as it improved the look of the UI across all pages. I have also finished sign up page, making some touches to login page and also fixed small bugs.

I want to have a fully functional show password icon in the future as well as getting reset password page finished and starting shop page.

I have made the reset password page and also merged the branch feature-reset-password into main. I have also made a new navbar just for the shop page and have also made a shop item component which holds the functionality to add items to the shop.

I want to in the future also have finished the shop navbar and have some functionality for the shopping bag.

### 27th November

Fixed minor bugs with reset button on game page as timer was continuing after clicking on reset button. Added popup functionality for shopping bag and functionality in the shop navbar like having the highlight feature stay when clicked for the nav links. Adding filter to the shopnav as well so it filters through coins, themes and skins.

I want to in the future have done a component to see what held in the shopping bag and adding placeholder items in the shopping bag.

### 28th November

I made shopping bag look better by adding further CSS to it and also made a component called bag item which would be inside shopping bag.I also noticed error after doing user testing which I fixed, i disabled the input box after quote has been correctly completed.

I want to in the future finish my checkout page and add extra feature which would be used in the future like adding errot message for login page if wrong password has been entered.

### 29th November

I added functionality to the shop bag items so that whatever is added it would output the total price and I ahve completed the checkout page as well as adding a new feature to the game page which is to have a running animation to go around the text whilst user is typing.

I had my supervisor meeting and showed my supervisor my current progress with my game and he mentioned how it was good and he also told me that for the report I should have testing like user testing and AB testing, Ishould have documented my code with JS DOC and also advice on what to mention in my report like what frameworks I used and explain how to use my website.

I want to in the future have a car instead of a yellow circle as the object being animated and also making sure it rotates properly as well and make it go with how the user is typing.

### 1st December

I have made the car animation rotate properly as well as making it animate whilst the user is typing and I made it so that the car would go back to the start once user is done typing. I have also set up express.js for backend.

In the future I would want to have added JSDOC to all files and also clean up code.

### 2nd - 4th December

Working on Interim report

## Week 11-12

### 5th December

I have cleaned up code and got rid of any code smells as well as adding JS DOC to all .jsx files.

In the future, I would want to have my read.me file and interim report finished.

## Week 13 - 14 (from 8th January)

### 13th January

Done research on how to set up backend properly as it was not actually connected to my front end yet.

This wasnt much of a struggle and I found it very useful. There wasnt any set backs and I would have done reseacrh the same exact way if I was to do it again.

### 15th January

I have added the foundations for the setting page and set everything up like import the navbar onto this page.

This wasnt a struggle and i would do the same thing again if i had to do it again.

### 16th January

I had my supervisor meeting where we set out an outline on what i have to have had done for the final report and we also discussed what to do for each section and went into detail as well.

### 18th January

I had done research on other game similar to mine and palnned on what I can do to make mine better like add a leaderboard on the home page and have a shop which sells stuff related to the game and keeps users interacted. These features arent seen in my competitors websites.

## Week 15 (from 22nd January)

### 25th January

Today, I did some research on how to add functionaility to my login/signUp page. I also did some work on my final report, I worked on the interim and further developed the rationale.

## Week 16-17 (from 29th January)

### 30th January

Today, I have started doing research into the final deliverables and what I need to have handed in by the end of this term and I want to ensure for the future that my code lives up to the standard of these requirements like having a fully functional software application.

### 3rd Febuary

Today, I did further research on how to implement a toggle functionality so that the user can switch from darkmode and lightmode.

I did have struggle taking the information in at first but after further research I understood it well and if I could do this again I would have wanted to start the functionality for this feature.

### 7th Febuary

Today, I did further reseacrh on login/signup so I know what exactly to do and how I can implement this make my login/signup page fully functional.

If I was to do this again i would want to have done the actual functionaility for my login page and get started.

### 11th Febuary

Today, I added the background feature in the settings page. This was just the template and doesnt have any functionality as of yet.

If I was to do this again I would have made sure to do further research and also try finish this feature so that it is fully functional in the backend as well.

## Week 18 (from 12th February)

### 17th Febuary

Today I have finally completed the functioanility for the login/signUp page so users could sign up and login and it would save the data to the database.

If I was to do this again I would have tried to add the logout button and also encrpyted password so that the users account information would not get hacked into. I will look into doing this further down the line.

### 18th Febuary

Today, I have fixed the sign up buttons placement as well as adding cookie functionality to the backend to keep persistence of signed in users and also added user Context to frontend.

I had minor difficulty trying to add the cookie functionality but after further research, it helped me figure out what to do and accomplish this task.

## Week 19-20 (from 19th February)

### 19th Febuary

Today, I have set up the fundamentals for the account page which also has a mini navbar within it so that it leads to different sections like update details, Owned items and statistics. I have fixed minor bugs in the account Navbar and also added commenst for Account.jsx.

If I was to do this again I would have also set up the fundamental for owned Items and statistics as well. I had no issues when I was completeing these tasks.

### 20th Febuary

Today, I made a component for account nav bar so that it is easier and code looks more readble in the differnet files which contain the account navbar. I have also finished up the statsistics page as well as the owned items page and fixed small bugs in the account page.

I have also added functionality for the dark/lightmode feature as well as changing the font colors when in light mode to improve readbility. I have also chnaged the logo for when in light mode as well. I have also fixed minor bugs in different pages due to the lightmode like changing the font color when in light mode.

I also made the naviagte function work for my account in shopnav as well as changing the placeholders I had in setting to actual fonts I will be using in the website. I have also added functionality for the fonts so that it is displayed throughout the website. I have also added a slow transition to switch from lightmode to darkmode or vice versa.

I had no issues when completeing these tasks but i did struggle trying to find suitable fonts to use so that the user would still be able to fully utilize the website.

### 21st Febuary

I have fixed the font color in the game when in lightmode when I was doing user testing.

If I was to do this again I would have wante dto do user testing earlier so that I would have figured out this issue and more potential issues earlier on.

### 23rd Febuary

I have added images for coins and added css to it to look better in the shop page as well as adding skins in the shop page as well. I assigned the correct prices for these items and also fixed minor bugs in the shop.

I had no issues when completeing these tasks but if I was to do this again I would have wanted to also add the themes in as well.

### 29th febuary

I had a supervisor meeting where I showed my supervisor my current progress within my website as well as talk about any concerns i had with the final report submission.

I also addedcoins section and a place to purchase coins in the navbar and added CSS to it to make it look better.

If I was to do this again i would have made the coin page seperate to the shop so that it would function better. I had no issues completeimg these tasks.

### 2nd March

Today, I have fixed bugs with the hover effect in the navbar and also added a naviafte function for the plus button to purchase coins as well as adding navbar componenet in the coins page.

I have had no issues with these tasks so far. If i was to do this again I would have also tried to add the new coins page I mentioned on the 29th febuary.

### 3rd March

Today, I have made changes to the shopnav so that the coins button would lead to the new coins page and I also added a route for the new checkout for shop for just coins. I ended up finishing the coins checkout page. I also added navigate feature for purchasing more coins in coin checkout page and alos added the correct navbar for payment checkout for coins.

If I was to do this again i would have wanted to have the coins balance fully functional so that it shows the user how many coins currently have. I also had no issues when doing these tasks.

## Week 21-23 (from 4th March)

### 4th March

Today, I have created the bag context file as well as frontend code to store the shopping bag for coins and this queries the backend to update the coin balance. I have also added styling for order summary section in the checkout page and i have fixed bugs on shopnav styling for coin section.

If I was to do this again I would haveb tried to do more work on the coins balance and also add it to the shop nav so that the user can actively see their blance when trying to purchase any items.

### 8th March

Today, I have added the coin balance in the shop nav and the functionality to purchase coin and updated the coin balance in mongo db.

If i was to do this again I would havde doen more thing slike also add functionality so that the coin balance is functional only when the user is logged in.

### 9th March

I have refactored the code for checking if users are logged in to checkLoggedIn function and i also added functionality to logout which adds cookie to the blacklist upon logging out. I also made it so that the navbar shows the coin balance only when the user is logged in.

I have also added frontend changes for adding non-coin items to the shopping bag and made it display the correct info on checkout and making it work for normal shop items.

Owned items page now loads ites from the backend which shows what the user has purchased and able to change the skin from owned items in the game. I have also added functionality to save the records of the users races to the backend.

If i was to do this again I would have done things differently like I would have wanted to add themes to the shop so that it would have completed the shop page. I had no struggles when completing this task.

### 13th March

I done research this day on what to add for my themes shop and I have also started laying out my report to see what section I need to include as well as section I need to improve from interim report.

### 16th March

I have added functionality so that it shows the images in owned items as well as the name and I added CSS to make it look better like adjusted the images and added a highlight feature so that it shows the user what is currently selected and I also removed the button Change skin as it was redundant.

I have also refactored the filtering function for the shop into ints own component and i refactored the code so that when the user checks out the users data would automatically be updated.

I also fixed the overflow issue by implementing a scrollbar in the owned items page as well as fixing the logout refresh issue I had.

If I was to do this again I would have done the same things again as I have now learnt from these issues I had and would know how to prevent them in the future. The only setbacks I had was the overflow issue on owned items page and the logout refresh issue.

### 18th March

Today, I have removed the quantity section from the shopping bag as well as fix minor bugs within the shopping bag like make the total cost work and also fix the positioning of where the price was and adding a coin icon instead of a pound sign as well.

I also added functionality for the total cost in the checkout page as well as adding minor styling for the checkout page like adding a pound sign for total cost.

I have also added images for light and dark mode in settings so that the user can see what it woyuld look like before choosing what mode they want. I also added some minor CSS to this section to make it look better.

If I was to do this again I would not change anything as I felt like this was very simple bug fixex but I do wish I could have done more work to the shop page liek add the themes to it.

### 23rd March

Today, I have imported new gif files as the old gif files were making the website crash and I added them to the shop with corresponding names. I have also seperated the original owned items to 2 seperate pages called skins and another page called themes.
Both these pages were fully functional and I also added functionality to the trash icon which can be seen in the bag in shop or order summary in checkout pages. I have also finished the frontend styling for the leaderboard section in home page.

If i was to do this again I wouldnt make any changes as I feel like I have accomplished alot within this day but i did have one set back which was trying to compress the gif files for themes as they were too big for my website and kept making not only my website crash but also my IDE.

### 24th March

I have added alot of minor improvements within the website like adding a blur so that it improves readbility when the user buys a theme and uses it they will not have a hard time navigating through the website. I have also added a change password section within the update details page in My account, I made the password hashed so that users details would be alot more secure and I also added toast notifications for pages which through errors like login and sign up page as well as the checkout pages. I also made my leaderboard section fully functional so it takes in users names and there average speed and ranks them in the leaderboard.

If i was to do this all over again I would have wanted to implement the toast notification feature alot earlier as well as the leaderboard if I had don efurther research earlier. I also had no struggles completeing these tasks.

## Week 24-25 (from 25th March)

### 25th March

I added functionality on the frontend with axios to submit the account changes on the update details page as well as doing the backend. I have now fully completed my project and all features are fully functional. In the near future I would just have to go back and comment code as well as potentially fix minor bugs.

Whilst doing this I had minor setbacks but after alot of research I ended up figuring it out. In addition, if I was to do this again I wish I would have done further research earlier on so that it would have helped me accomplish this last task alot sooner.

### 27th March

I had my supervisor meeting where we looked through my current report and my finished product. We went into more detail on what I had to do for stuff I had yet to complete and also how I could achieve top marks for these parts of the reports. I also decided to remove the duration from the leaderboard as it was dead code.

If i was to have the supervisor meeting again I would have asked the same questions again as it really helped me identify the key parts I need to focus on.

### 29th March

I have added JSDoc commenst for Account.css as well as all the backend files like blacklist.jsx, client.js, authenticate.js and index.js.

If I was to do this again I would have done the commenst as I am writing the code as it would be alot easier but other than that I have no other issues.

### 30th March

I have added comments for CoinItem.jsx, Checkout.css, checkout.jsx, BagItem.jsx, BagContext.jsx, Bag.jsx, App.jsx, AccountNav.jsx and AccountNav.jsx.

If I was to do this again I would have doen it alot earlier when I was writing the code for these files so that it would have saved time.

### 31st March

I have added JSDoc comments for themeContext.jsx, themes.jsx, UserContext.jsx, game.jsx, game.css, login.jsx, login.css, Navbar.jsx and Navbar.css. I also fixed some minor bugs like fixing the color of the text when in lightmode and i also added the see password icon in Account page so that the user can see the password they have typed in.

If I was to do this again I would do it differnetly as I would have tried to do the comments alot earlier whilst I am writing the code.

### 1st April

I have added JSdoc comments on the following files Coins.jsx, Coins.css, Home.jsx, Home.css, main.jsx, OwnedItems.css, ResetPassword.jsx, ResetPassword.css, settings.jsx, settings.css, Shop.jsx, Shop.css, ShopFilter.jsx, ShopItem.jsx, ShopNav.jsx, ShopNav.css, SignUp.jsx, SignUp.css, skins.jsx, Statistics.jsx and Statistics.css .

I also removed index.jsx as it was redundant.

If i was to do this again I would have doen it alot earlier whilst I was writing the code so that it saves me time in the future.

### 2nd April

I have fully updated my diary as well as doing the professional issues section in my final year report.

### 6th April

I have finished my Final year report as well as update my readme file. I have also fixed some grammer mistakes within some comments in the code.
