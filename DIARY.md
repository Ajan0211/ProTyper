# Ajanthapan's Diary

## Week 1

### 25th September

Reasearched on ideas for what to base my website on. Also researched what databases and frontend tools I would be using for my project.
Looked into Mongo DB for my database and potentially React for my front end development.

### 27th September

Went to my first supervisor meeting where we discussed further on potential ideas for my website (clothing brand or type racer game).

Also looked into ideas on how I can further get extra marks for my fyp; using a no SQL database would give me more marks.

We also discussed the benefits for using a no SQL database as it is more logical and easier to use than a SQL database.
