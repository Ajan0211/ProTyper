# Advanced Web Development - ProTyper

This project is for people who are slow at typing and wish to have fun whilst improving their typing speed.

## Documentation

After cloning my repository you should have all the necessary files to run the code. Now you would have to install react + vite so that you can open my website.

You would first open up your preferred IDE and open up my PROJECT. You should then go to the terminal and type in the following:

```
  cd pro-typer
```

After you enter this file which has all the necessary files you should type in the following:

```
  npm install
```

When you have installed this, you do the following:

```
  npm run dev
```

This should then give you a link which would send you straight to my website.

You would have to now press ctrl + click on the link to access my website.

It should open up the home page of ProTyper on your preferred browser.
